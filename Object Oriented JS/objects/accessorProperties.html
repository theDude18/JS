    <title>Accessor Properties</title>
    <script>
        //Till now we have seen only normal properties(data properties).
        //In Java, we used to keep the varibles private and use getters and setters method to access the variable;
        //In JS, we can achieve the same by using Accessor properties
        var person={
            _name:"Mark Antony",       //accessor variable property
            _age:18,

            get name(){          //This is not normal function property; This is accessor function property so the syntax differs;
                return this._name;
            },

            set name(value){
                this._name=value;
            },

            get age(){
                return this._age;
            },

            set age(value){
                this._age=value;
            }
        };

        console.log(person.name);   //this invokes the get name() and through this accessor method it returns the name;
        console.log(person.age);    //this invokes the get age();  
        
        person.name="Baasha";         //this passess the "Baasha" in set name() and through the accessor function, it sets the name; It will not directly set the name like in normal data property.  
        person.age=16;
        console.log(person.name);     //while calling get method(name()), dont give brackets '()'. Bcoz accessor function property is actually like a variable accessor property internally.
        console.log(person.age);

        //Without get() method you can't retrieve a accessor property. Obj becomes write only.
        //Without set() method you can't set a value in accessor property. Obj becomes read only.

        /*Note: In accessor properties, only if you define getter and setter methods, JS can get and set the accessor properties through these methods. If there is no setter method and u set a accessor property, JS creates a new property with the same name but without underscore symbol((i.e)not a accessor property but a normal property)
        Eg: If u try to set person.age without setter method, JS will check for setter method and if it is not there then it will create a new property named 'age'
            var person={
            _name:"Mark Antony",       //accessor variable property
            _age:18,                   //accessor variable property
            age:16                     //normal variable property
            }                 
        So it is always the best practice to define getter and setter methods for all the accessor properties you create.
