    <title>BTS of creating properties in Object</title>
    <script>
        var obj1={         //object creation using literal form
            "name":"Thala" //when you create a property called name, JS internally executes put() function and allocate a memory in the obj1 memory and add this property.
        }

        var obj2=new Object();  //object creation using new keyword
        obj2.name="IlayaThalapathi"; //when you create a property called name, JS internally executes put() function and allocate a memory in the obj2 memory and add this property.
        
        obj1.name="AK";         //when you change/modify a property, JS internally executes set() function and it will not allocate any new memory. It will use the already allocated memory.
        obj2.name="Thalapathi"; //when you change/modify a property, JS internally executes set() function and it will not allocate any new memory. It will use the already allocated memory.
        
        //'in' operator - used to check if the property and function is there in obj or not.
        console.log("name" in obj1); //Instead of document.write(), we can use console.log() which will print the contents in console(dev tools of browser)
        //property(name) shld be given in double quotes when using 'in' operator; we can also check if function is present or not by giving function name.

        console.log("description" in obj1); //this will return false as description property is not present in obj1.
        console.log("toString" in obj2);  //In JS, every obj we create has a parent obj called Object() internally. This parent obj containes toString() method defaultly. So any obj we create, have this toString() internally.
    
        //'hasOwnProperty()' 
        //In JS, we can inherit objects, which means, we can use the properties of inherited object. To check if the property of an object is its own or it is from its inherited parent obj, we can use hasOwnProperty();
        console.log(obj1.hasOwnProperty("name"));
        console.log(obj1.hasOwnProperty("toString")); //this will return false bcoz toString() is not a own function of obj1. It is inherited from its parent obj Object(inbuilt generic object).
    
        //deleting a property - In JS, objects are very dynamic bcoz properties can be added,modified & deleted at any point.
        obj1.realName="Ajith Kumar"; //adding a property
        console.log(obj1.realName);
        console.log(delete obj1.realName);        //this is the syntax to delete a property; this will return true if the property is there in obj and deleted.
        console.log(obj1.realName);               //now it wont print Ajith Kumar as it is deleted.
    
        //retreiving properties(both key and value of object)
        for(var eachProperty in obj1){
            console.log(eachProperty);      //prints key
            console.log(obj1[eachProperty]); //prints value
        }

        //retrieving all the keys of object using inbuilt generic Object
        var allProperties=Object.keys(obj1);   //Object.keys() returns an array which stores all the keys;
        console.log(allProperties);
        console.log(obj1[allProperties]);      //prints all the values of obj1

        //Enumerability check - propertyIsEnumerable()
        //Enumerable means properties which can be iterated; Properties of custom object are enumerable and properties of Inbuilt obj are not enumerable.
        console.log(obj1.propertyIsEnumerable("name"));
        console.log(allProperties.propertyIsEnumerable("length")); //allProperties is a array we declared but the property(length) is an inbuilt one; So enumerability is false;
        //Note: Properties of object include both the variable and function.
