    <script>
        //main use of prototype is memory management of object instances;
        //when we create multiple instances of a constructor function(object), each instances will be allocated a seperate memory; To overcome this, we use prototype so that all the instances will share the same memory location

        //Constructor function
        function Player(name,age){
            this.name=name,

            document.write("Player name is "+this.name+" and player age is "+this.age);
        };
        */

        //declaring multiple functions in constructor prototype
        Player.prototype={
            constructor:Player,   //whenever u r using literal form to create prototype, always mention constructor property and give the constructor function name(Player);
            display: function(){
                document.write(this.name+" "+this.age+"<br/>");
            },
            displayInfo: function(){
                document.write("Player name is "+this.name+" and player age is "+this.age+"<br/>");
            }
        };

        var p1=new Player("Jadeja",33);
        var p2=new Player("Dhoni",40);

        p1.display();
        p1.displayInfo();

        p2.display();
        p2.displayInfo();

        console.log(p1 instanceof Player);
        console.log(p1.constructor === Player); //returns true as we mentioned constructor property inside prototype
        console.log(p1.constructor === Object); //returns false; if we didnt mention constructor property inside prototype then JS automatically considers generic inbuilt obj 'Object' as the constructor; So it is always the best practice to mention constructor property inside prototype(when created in literal form);
        
        //Note: not only functions but we can also declare variables inside prototype
        //Note: constructor is a property every prototype has; Main purpose is constructor property is, whenever a obj instance is created for a prototype, this constructor property informs the instance, that this prototype is created for this/that constructor function. It helps in understanding the object's inheritance chain.
